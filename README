This is a set of manually created hex programs in a Cthulhu Path to madness fashion.
Which only have the goal of creating a bootstrapping path to a C compiler capable of
Compiling GCC, with only the explicit requirement of a single 1 KByte binary or less.

Additionally, all code must be able to be understood by 70% of the population of programmers.
If the code can not be understood by that volume, it needs to be altered until it satifies the above requirement.

This repo contains a few of my false start pieces that may be of interest to people who
want to independently create the root binary, I welcome all bug fixes and code that aids
in the above stated goal.

I'll be adding more code and documentation as I build pieces.
ALL code in this REPO is under the GPLv3 or Later.

In order to build stage0 and all the pieces, one only needs to run make all.
Each individual piece can be built by simply running make $piece with $piece being replaced by the actual part you want to make.

The only pieces that have any external dependencies are the Web IDE (Python3+CherryPy), libvm (GCC) and vm (GCC+GNU getopt)
