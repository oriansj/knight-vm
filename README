This repo contains a software emulator, assembler, disassembler and M1 macro definitions file for the Knight hardware platform.

Those wishing to run ancient binaries in a bug compatible fashion, should checkout stage0_foundation_version as it complies exactly with the specification.

Some liberties were taken in later commits to free up precious opcode space and simplify implementation.

ALL code in this REPO is under the GPLv3 or Later.
